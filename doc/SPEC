Astronomy core
- reftester performs random sampling
	+ computes max, avg, stand. dev. for disparities on all axes
	+ azimuth appears to be dead on except for >89Â° 
		max     169.3811   avg   0.02667119   sig     1.718771
	+ elevation - same story
		max     6.067281   avg 0.0002334774   sig   0.02299056
	+ solar noon accurate (30 sec diff)
        max           31   avg       3.4406   sig     6.579849
	+ sunset is problematic (up to 40min diff)
		max        10098   avg     22.06961   sig     116.7401
	+ worst sunrise recorded is 2h
	    max        10138   avg     25.35367   sig     192.4771
- possible solution: rigorous analysis of floating point ops
	+ bound to be costly
	+ may not help, no guarantee not knowing what the problem is
	+ may have implications for performance
- verification against other sources?
	+ gaisma is an option, but disallows queried access

Plotting
- Backdrop done
- Graphing
	+ simple point plotting works
		- what about line thickness?
	+ needs optimize for resolution
		- calculate at what frequency points collide dynamically, starting medium dense
	+ bitmap to file needs a legend
	+ bench for redraw speed
		- may need a progress bar while redraw
			=> multithreaded
	+ full graph rendering
		- render backdrop
		- plot interested data points for particular dates/times in colors
		- plot labels for said points
		- plot labels for hours of day
		- plot day and time dynamically on input, reuse precomputed result
		from above

Location database
- Services
	+ stored locations
	+ with timezone/dst data
	+ stores particular precomputed location-times
- Representation
	+ regular class
	+ serialize to xml

Timezone/DST
- Offer timezone/dst lookup for arbitrary coordinates

Gui
- Inputs
	+ Longitude
	+ Latitude
	+ Timezone
	+ DST
		- core logic missing
	+ Location name
		- db missing
	+ Toggable sun rendering for particular date and time
- Dynamic inputs (sliders?)
	+ Date
	+ Time
- Outputs
	+ Elevation
	+ Azimuth
	+ Sunrise
	+ Sunset
	+ Solar noon
- Additional in SunOrb
	+ Day length?  Y 
	+ Yearly sunhours?  N
	+ Yearly average day length?  N

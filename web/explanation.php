		<h1>Explanation</h1>

		A solar diagram shows the position (and in general, the trajectory) of the sun at a given time of day, for a given day of the year. It answers the questions:
		<ul>
			<li>Where is the sun in the sky?</li>
			<li>How high in sky is the sun at noon?</li>
			<li>When does the sun rise and set?</li>
			<li>How many hours of sunlight are there in January?</li>
			<li>How different (in terms of sunlight) is a day in summer from a day in winter?</li>
		</ul>
		As you might expect, the answers differ depending on where you are on Earth.

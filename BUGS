- The Monodevelop generated build (on Ubuntu) crashes (fails on start, no useful error message) on Win7 x64.
    - Workaround: Build on Win7/Xamarin Studio 5/NET 4.0
        Seems to run on all platforms:
            - Win 7 x86 & 
            - Win 7 x64
            - WinXP
            - Ubuntu 14.04 x86
            - Ubuntu 14.04 x64
